# During Your Research

## (Meta)data
- **Version Control and Backups**: Implement data version control and regular backups to track changes and prevent data loss.
- **Raw Data Preservation**: Maintain versions of raw data to facilitate reproducibility and allow others to preprocess data as needed.
- **Security Measures**: Apply strong security protocols to protect sensitive or confidential data, following best practices for data protection.
- **Data Annotation**: If annotating data, define clear guidelines, select appropriate tools, and determine the level of annotation required.

## Code, Models, and Software
- **Clean Code Practices**: Adhere to clean code principles, including the use of unit tests, to enhance code quality.
- **Result Documentation**: Document all intermediate research results, such as evaluation scores and model parameters, for future analysis.
- **Version Control**: Utilize version control systems to manage changes and collaborate effectively.
- **Energy Consumption Monitoring**: Monitor and document the energy consumption of computational resources, aiming to minimize environmental impact.
